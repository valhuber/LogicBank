    https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/orm/cascades.html
    The default behavior of cascade is limited to cascades of the so-called
    save-update and merge settings.
    The typical “alternative” setting for cascade is to
    add the delete and delete-orphan options;
    these settings are appropriate for related objects which only exist
    as long as they are attached to their parent, and are otherwise deleted.

    #unitofwork-cascades.
    The all symbol is a synonym for
    save-update, merge, refresh-expire, expunge, delete,
    and using it in conjunction with delete-orphan indicates that
    the child object should follow along with its parent in all cases,
    and be deleted once it is no longer associated with that parent.
