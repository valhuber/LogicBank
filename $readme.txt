FIXME design - search for these, which designate request for external review
TODO major - designates significant unimplemented

Major friction due to Python Path
    Pycharm sets it (thankyou), but cmd-line, vsc (etc) do not
    Run > Configurations, unset Source & Content Roots
    This should make debug runs == cmd-line, vsc

Significant bug fixes:
    See nw/trans_tests/upd_order_reuse, and logic_engine/exec_row_logic/logic_row#save_altered_parents


Various misc copy/paste:

update orderdetail set amount = unitPrice * quantity

update "Order" set AmountTotal =
(select sum(orderdetail.amount) from orderdetail where orderdetail.orderid = "Order".id);

select id, customerid, shippeddate, amounttotal from "Order" where id = 11011;

select ProductName, UnitsInStock, UnitsShipped from Product where id = 58;

select id, balance, creditlimit from customer where id="ALFKI";
    960

update Customer set Balance =
(select sum("Order".amounttotal) from "Order" where Customer.id = "Order".customerid
and "Order".shippeddate is null);

update Customer set UnpaidOrderCount =
(select count("Order".amounttotal) from "Order" where Customer.id = "Order".customerid
and "Order".shippeddate is null);

update Customer set Balance = 0 where balance is null;
update Customer set Balance = 960  where id="ALFKI";

update Customer set creditlimit = balance + 100;

830 orders, 21 not shipped
    11045 for BOTTM (22607.7 ==> 1309.5)
    ALFKI has balance=0

OrderList fails on 10248 : 10272 (no orphans to Customer, Employee) - serving.py @ 314
ha!  Due to a null row - deleted it, runs fine now
